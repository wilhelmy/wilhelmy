- 👋 Hi, I’m @wilhelmy
- 👀 I’m interested in migrating off of GitHub but it's hard because COMPANIES DON'T FUCKING FEDERATE. As a result of big corporations centralising the internet among themselves I have mostly ceased to write software. If you have some optimism for the future left in you, I'm willing to help.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things that aren't software
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Free/Open Source Software and projects that benefit the commons (ideally while at the same time forcing corporations to pay for them but one can dream)
- 📫 How to reach me mw+%/nospam@barfooze.de
